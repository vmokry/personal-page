    <h1>FAQ about my events</h1>
    <p class="post-info">Published on Jan 3, 2025<p>

        <h5>How many people do you expect?</h5>
        <p>I’ve hosted as few as five people and as many as over twenty. However, since I just moved here, I expect fewer attendees. Building a proper community takes time. What matters is the quality of the conversation, not the quantity.</p>
        
        <h5>Can I invite a friend?</h5>
        <p>Yes, if they are someone you wouldn’t mind spending time with on a deserted island. :)</p>
        
        <h5>Do I need to bring anything?</h5>
        <p>I’ll provide tea, tasty drinks, and healthy <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=canapes&t=h_&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images">canapés</a>. You can bring something worth sharing, especially if you enjoy cooking or baking. Please avoid bringing junk food – we’re better than that.</p>
        
        <h5>How do I know that people there will be cool?</h5>
        <p>Well... you don’t.</p>
        <p>I curate my events and carefully choose who to invite, but I can be wrong sometimes. However, as I find you cool, eventually there will be some convergence.</p>
        
        <h5>Do I need to RSVP?</h5>
        <p>Not really. What matters is that you show up.</p>
        <p>Here’s the corrected version:

            Generally, people who don’t show up or don’t answer eventually stop being invited. But that’s life – you can please some of the people, some of the time.</p>
        
        

<h5>Anything else I should keep in mind?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Come here with an open mind.</li>
<li>Listen more.</li>
<li>Avoid stealing conversations.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Birthdays</h3>
        <h5>What about presents?</h5>
        <p>Please don’t bring me gifts. Your presence is more important to me.</p>
