    <h1>FAQ about my events</h1>
    <!--<p class="post-info">Published on Jan 3, 2025<p>-->

        <h5>How many people do you expect?</h5>
        <p>I’ve hosted as few as five people and as many as over twenty. However, since I just moved here, I expect fewer attendees. Building a proper community takes time. What matters is the quality of the conversation, not the quantity.</p>
        
        <h5>Can I invite a friend?</h5>
        <p>A close friend or your partner is welcome!</p>
        
        <h5>Do I need to bring anything?</h5>
        <p>I’ll provide tea, drinks, and healthy <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=canapes&t=h_&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images">canapés</a>. Feel free to <abbr title="bring your own drink">BYOD</abbr> or bring something to share. But please, no junk food, we’re better than that.</p>
    
        <h5>How do I know that people there will be cool?</h5>
        <p>Well... you don’t.</p>
        <p>I curate my events and carefully choose who to invite, but I can be wrong sometimes. However, as I find you cool, eventually there will be some convergence.</p>
        
        <h5>Do I need to <abbr title="répondez s'il vous plaît / please respond">RSVP</abbr>?</h5>
        <p>Not really. What matters is that you show up.</p>
        <p>Generally, people who don’t show up or don’t answer eventually stop being invited. But that’s life – you can please some of the people, some of the time.</p>
        
        <!--<h5>Do you speak French?</h5>
        <p>Pour être honnête, tous mes amis parlent français. I am late to party. Please give me some time to get better.</p>
    -->

<!--<h5>Anything else I should keep in mind?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Come here with an open mind.</li>
<li>Listen more.</li>
<li>Avoid stealing conversations.</li>
</ul>-->

    <!--    <h3>Birthday</h3>
        <h5>What about presents?</h5>
        <p>Please don’t bring me gifts. Your presence is more important to me.</p>-->
