    <h1>Frequently asked question about my events.</h1>
    <p class="post-info">Published on Jan 2, 2025<p>

        <h5>How many people do you expect?</h5>
        <p>I hosted just five people but also over twenty. But as I just moved here, I expect less. It takes time to build a proper community. What matters is a quality of converstaion, not quantity. </p>
        
        
        
        <h5>Can I invite a friend?</h5>
            <p>The answer is Yes, if she/he is the person you would don't mind spend time on a deserted island. :) Your siginificant other is always welcome.</p>

        <h5>Do I need to bring anything?</h5>
        <p>
            I’ll provide tea, tasty drinks, and healthy canapés. You can bring anything worth sharing, especially if you like cooking / baking. Please, avoid brining junk food, we are better than that.</p>

        <h5>How do I know that people there will be cool?</h5>

        <p>Well, you don't. I currate my events and chose who to invite. For example, people who do not reply are eventually dropped. People who I find not compatible with my values also. But that is a life. You can please some of the poeple, some of the time.</p>

            <h3>Birthsdays</h3>
            <h5>What about presents</h5>
            <p>Please, no need for gifts to me. Your presence is more important to me.</p>
