        <h2>New Beginnings, Act II.</h2>
        <p class="small">Published on April 24, 2020</p>

          <p>Time flies extremely fast. A year and a half ago I wrote an article about my decision to switch from a career of a visual designer to a
            concept artist.</p>
          <p>So here I am, after an intensive year and a half of learning, with a diploma from Syn Studio Concept Art School in my hand.</p>
          <p>Of course, in the grand scheme of things, the diploma does not matter. In the entertainment industry, what matters is your stellar portfolio. And to be open to the feedback, and eager to grow.</p>
          <p>The main advantage of the concept art diploma program is to put 20 ambitious individuals together. Add experienced artists/lecturers, life drawing sessions, art jams and networking events, shake it and cook on high-value flame for 18
            months.</p>
          <p>Expected result? Industry-ready concept artist.</p>
          <p>I still have difficulties to follow the North-American way of communication. I like to get to the point. I believe that my directness is helpful, but here more than elsewhere, you need to learn the small-talk and avoid the
            misunderstanding.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I got an art commission, but I also found myself designing user interfaces between the classes and revisiting my old profession. Living costs in Canada are demanding and I wanted to increase my constrained student budget. And
            aside from a few trips beyond the city, I really did not have time to learn more about Quebec province or master the French language.&nbsp;There will be more time for this later.</p>
          <p>I made a few new friends, met awesome people from various industries and learn a lot of inside information from our lecturers and other artists. My art skills also levelled up.</p>
          <p>Finally, graduating was anti-climatic. Instead of having a remarkable gala evening and drinking beers with teachers, we spent our last days glued to screens in online meetings in non-voluntary isolation. I guess nobody counted with a
            global pandemic in their business plans.</p>
          <p>Was going abroad to study concept art worth it?</p>
          <p>I wanted to answer this question after I would get a job, but as the future is uncertain (and hiring is on hold), I will keep the final review for later. However, I see progress in my work, and that makes me confident. I am fully engaged
            in job hunting, so cross your fingers for me!</p>
          <p>Now you should probably check my current artwork on <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/vmokry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.artstation.com/vmokry"  class="link" target="_blank"

        <h2>New Beginnings</h2>
        <p class="small">Published on September 12, 2018</p>
        <p class="has-margin">Last year in Tokyo I realized what I want to do with my life.* And that is drawing concepts, illustrations, fantasy and sci-fi worlds. And be paid for it. :)</p>
        <p>So nine months ago I have started drawing digitally again and applied to Syn Studio in Montreal, one of the elite Concept Art schools in the world. To my surprise, they have selected me as one of the twenty students. Hence in nine days, I
          am leaving for Canada for one and a half year study, where I will be learning from the best.</p>
        <p>It wonâ€™t be easy. Expectations are to draw 60 hours per week. I will draw like crazy. And I am taking a considerable loan for that.</p>
        <p>But damn, I have to do that. Every time I open Procreate or take a pencil I feel so happy that I have to try to get there. To work in the game or movie industry and bring ideas to life.</p>
        <p>I am leaving here our design &amp; prototyping studio, <a class="link" href="https://statusquack.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Status Quack</a>. Luckily in a good shape. This summer we have delivered some awesome design
          solutions for home automatizations, car enthusiasts, and children that are challenged by borders and feelings of their parents.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Also, I am leaving Geewa, a game company that gave me the opportunity to taste what concept art is. These guys are awesome and I am confident to say that their next game will have a similar success.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Last but not least, I also have to say many thanks to every family member and friend that supported me with a loan or a piece of advice. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Do you want to support me? You still can! If you want any of my illustrations from <a class="link" href="https://vmokry.artstation.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vmokry.artstation.com</a> hanging on your wall, write me and I
          will prepare a canvas print for you. And if you want to draw something else, yes, I accept commisions.</p>
        <p>Everyone else, follow my journey on Instagram <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/vmokry/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">@vmokry</a>.</p>
